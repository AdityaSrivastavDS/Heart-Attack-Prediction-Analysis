# Heart Attack Risk Prediction Model

## Overview

This project involves the development of a heart attack risk prediction model using logistic regression. The model aims to predict the likelihood of a patient experiencing a heart attack based on various clinical factors. The project includes data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation.

## Features

- **Logistic Regression Model**: Utilizes logistic regression to predict heart attack risk with high accuracy.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Includes feature engineering and data cleaning to enhance model performance.
- **Evaluation Metrics**: Assesses model performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
- **Cross-Validation**: Implements cross-validation to ensure the robustness and reliability of the model.

## Tech Stack

- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Libraries**: Scikit-learn, NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib
- **Development Environment**: Jupyter Notebook or IDEs like PyCharm

## Installation

To get started with the project, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/AdityaSrivastavDS/Heart-Attack-Prediction-Analysis
